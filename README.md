## Summary:

Problem Statement: Almost 90 percent of small businesses in India still have no links with formal financial institutions. 

     Primary reasons are 
          for borrowers - borrowers do not have 
                           adequate tools for consent managemen 
                           and networks infrastrucure to promote financial inclusion
          
          for lenders  - lenders do not have 
                          easy ways to access borrowing capacity leading to high defaults and NPAs
                          validate small business workflow and cashflow needs and their veracity on adequate amounts AT THE TIME OF NEED
                          adaptive decision making tools to quickly respond to macro economic events

## Research:
  
          Loans to  micro and small businesses shrinking even through 2020. Banks have started to reduce working capital limits, increase risk premium — 
          thereby charging effective interest of over 16% — and insist on additional security when these SMEs are not even generating positive EBITDA
          
          Even with Priority Sector Lending guidelines, most retail banks have not been able to extend credit as the NPA rates are high.
          
          Even Government loan schemes are finding it difficult to disburse credit to low ticket borrowers, a key for recovery in India.


## Reasons: 

          Low Credit Literacy, Awareness and ease of use and convenience tools for accessing credit. 

          The loan application process is daunting. Most business owners resort to informal lending. Data Privacy and user preferences are not a priority.

          Rigid and outdated methods for underwriting. Banks need to focus on repayment capacity at the appraisal stage and monitor the loans through the lifecycle           much more closely – RBI Deputy Governor. 

          High Loan originating , processing and maintenance costs for Lenders, due to non-standard and often archaic integrations.


## Solution:

          Loan services platform (AA Client) leveraging  Account Aggregator Framework initiated in India, with the following enablers

Technical
